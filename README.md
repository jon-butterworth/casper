## Casper - The friendly Slack Bot
Casper is a slack bot written in Python and optimised to run in Docker or Kubernetes. It was developed as a bit of an educational project.

Since Slack RTM (real time messaging) is out of date and due to be decommissioned, this bot uses even subscription.

More information will follow on how to use the bot, but for now feel free to take a look at the source code etc and ask any questions if you're stuck.
